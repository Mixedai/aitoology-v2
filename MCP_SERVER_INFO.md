## Installation Summary

The Supabase MCP (Model Context Protocol) server has been successfully set up for your AIToologist project.

## What's Been Done

1. **Created MCP Server Structure:**
   - `/mcp-server/src/index.js` - Main server implementation
   - `/mcp-server/package.json` - Dependencies configuration
   - `/mcp-server/README.md` - Documentation

2. **Implemented Supabase Tools:**
   - `supabase_query` - Query data from tables
   - `supabase_insert` - Insert new records
   - `supabase_update` - Update existing records
   - `supabase_delete` - Delete records
   - `supabase_auth_signup` - Sign up new users
   - `supabase_auth_signin` - Sign in existing users

3. **Configured Claude Desktop:**
   - Added Supabase MCP server to `claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Connected to your Supabase project
   - Ready to use in Claude Desktop

## How to Use

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new MCP configuration

2. **Available Commands in Claude:**
   - Query tools: `SELECT * FROM tools WHERE category = 'AI'`
   - Insert user: `INSERT INTO profiles (email, name) VALUES (...)`
   - Update tool: `UPDATE tools SET featured = true WHERE id = ...`
   - Delete record: `DELETE FROM subscriptions WHERE id = ...`

## Environment Variables Used

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Public anon key for client access

## Security Notes

- The MCP server uses the anon key which respects RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Never expose the service role key in client-side code
- All database operations follow your Supabase security rules

## Testing the Server

To test if the server is working:
1. Restart Claude Desktop
2. Check if Supabase tools appear in the available tools
3. Try a simple query like getting all tools

## Troubleshooting

If the server doesn't work:
1. Make sure Claude Desktop is fully closed and restarted
2. Check that the paths in `claude_desktop_config.json` are correct
3. Verify that your Supabase credentials are valid
4. Check Claude Desktop logs for any error messages

## Next Steps

You can now:
- Query and manage your AI tools database directly from Claude
- Create and manage user accounts
- Update tool information and categories
- Manage user subscriptions and wallets

The MCP server provides a seamless integration between Claude and your Supabase backend!
