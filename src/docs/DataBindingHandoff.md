# Data Binding Handoff Notes

## Mock Dataset: toolsData

This document outlines the data binding structure for the AI Toologist application, specifically for the Explore cards and Tool Detail page mock rendering.

### Primary Dataset Location
**File**: `/data/mockTools.ts`  
**Export**: `toolsData` (JS array)  
**Usage**: Primary data source for Explore and Tool Detail pages

### Dataset Structure

Each tool object in `toolsData` contains exactly these fields:

```typescript
interface ToolData {
  id: string;           // Unique slug identifier (e.g., "chatgpt", "midjourney")
  name: string;         // Display name (e.g., "ChatGPT", "MidJourney")
  description: string;  // 1-2 sentence overview
  category: string;     // Category classification
  pricing: string;      // Pricing model: "Free", "Freemium", "Paid"
  features: string[];   // Array of 3-5 key features
  website: string;      // Production-ready URL
  logo: string;         // Emoji representation
  rating: number;       // 1-5 stars (float, e.g., 4.7)
  reviews: string[];    // Array of user testimonial strings
}
```

```

### Data Categories Covered

**7 Categories Total:**
- **Chatbot**: ChatGPT, Claude (2 tools)
- **Design**: MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, Figma AI (3 tools)  
- **Productivity**: Notion AI (1 tool)
- **Development**: GitHub Copilot (1 tool)
- **Research**: Perplexity AI (1 tool)
- **Video**: Runway ML (1 tool)
- **Writing**: Grammarly (1 tool)

### Pricing Distribution

- **Free**: 1 tool (Stable Diffusion)
- **Freemium**: 6 tools (ChatGPT, Notion AI, Perplexity, Claude, Figma AI, Grammarly)
- **Paid**: 3 tools (MidJourney, GitHub Copilot, Runway ML)

### Navigation Binding

**Key Field**: `id` (slug)  
**Usage**: Primary identifier for URL routing and component navigation  
**Example**: 
- Card click ‚Üí `/tool-detail` with `tool_id: "chatgpt"`
- Analytics tracking ‚Üí `toolCardClick("chatgpt", "ChatGPT")`

### Backward Compatibility

The system maintains compatibility with existing components through:
1. **MOCK_TOOLS**: Auto-generated from `toolsData` with additional computed fields
2. **Helper functions**: `getToolById()`, `getAllTools()`, `getToolsByCategory()`
3. **Enhanced fields**: Auto-generated `users`, `tags`, `verified`, `trending`, `featured` status

### Component Integration

**Explore Cards**: 
- Use `toolsData` via `MOCK_TOOLS` export
- Display: `name`, `description`, `category`, `rating`, `pricing`, `logo`
- Navigation: `id` field for routing

**Tool Detail Pages**:
- Use `getToolById(id)` to fetch individual tool data
- Display: All fields including `features[]` and `reviews[]`
- Enhanced with computed metadata for full experience

### Development Notes

- **Data Source**: Single source of truth in `/data/mockTools.ts`
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for both `toolsData` and `MockTool`
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools or modify existing ones
- **Production Ready**: All website URLs are real and functional
- **Analytics Ready**: Each tool has unique `id` for event tracking

This structure ensures consistent data across all AI Toologist components while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
